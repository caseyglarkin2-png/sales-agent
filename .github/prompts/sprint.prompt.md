## Instructions

2. Check `docs/CASEYOS_SPRINT_ROADMAP.md` for the next incomplete task
3. Use the todo list to track progress
4. For each task:
   - Check if infrastructure already exists (search codebase first)
   - Build only what's missing
   - Write tests if appropriate
   - Update relevant docs
5. Commit with clear message
6. Push to production
7. Verify endpoints work in production
8. Mark task complete
